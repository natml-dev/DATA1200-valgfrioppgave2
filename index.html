              <h3>Eu­ro­pean Project Se­mes­ter</h3>

              <p>European Project Semester (EPS) is a programme offered by several European universities to students who have completed at least two years of study. EPS is created with engineering students in mind, but other students who can participate in an engineering project are also welcome.</p>

              <p>EPS is a mixture of “Project Related Courses” and project organized/problem based learning. It is crafted to address the design requirements of the degree and prepare engineering students with all the necessary skills to face the challenges of today’s world economy. Students work in international and interdisciplinary teams of 3–6 students on their projects. Projects are done in cooperation with commercial businesses and industries or with research centers. There are minor differences between EPS-projects and the various EPS-providers, but all providers have agreed about the following key elements.</p>
